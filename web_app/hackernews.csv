Sure as heck is. It&#x27;s not realistic to expect a communications tool to somehow magically allow only &quot;good&quot; communication. Therefore, we have to resign ourselves to considering tools that:<p>(a) Make efficient, respectful, productive communication the default. Broadly speaking I would define this as making non-intrusive async communication (but making those conversations easily searchable&#x2F;browsable so you can &quot;catch up&quot; if desired) the default.<p>(b) Does not somehow <i>encourage</i> bad behavior.<p>I have plenty of nitpicks with Slack but I believe it passes those criteria. Some would say that the existence of @mentions makes it fail (b) but I can not agree. Certainly at my current employer, we have a nice Slack culture and it required zero pain to get there. Makes it a decent tool in my book.",1590414493,comment,,,0.3018,0.071

Two very obvious related guesses from my experience:<p>1.  Fingerprinting a user to help identify account takeover (ATO).  Open port signatures is probably a pretty good signal for that kind of thing (and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be measured in <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;panopticlick.eff.org&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;panopticlick.eff.org&#x2F;</a>).<p>&gt;  However it is also a valid tool used by administrators for remote access to machines, or by some end user support software, so the presence of VNC is a poor indicator of malware.<p>2.  In a Bayesian sense, this probably isn&#x27;t right.  I don&#x27;t know what eBay&#x27;s traffic looks like but I&#x27;m willing to bet that all other things being equal, traffic coming from a machine with an open VNC port is riskier.  Fraud detection is a game of probabilities, so the existence of a valid user showing a particular characteristic doesn&#x27;t mean that the characteristic isn&#x27;t useful in a fraud model.  The example I always give is that when I was doing this (quite some time ago), we could have had a 99% accuracy rate for a simple rule banning IPs from Turkey, Ghana, Nigeria, and Vietnam.  It&#x27;s not because there weren&#x27;t any valid users from those countries, it&#x27;s just that the fraudsters where overwhelmingly likely to be using IPs from those countries.",1589998620,comment,,,-0.8338,0.104

290,antonvs,23250093,[23272835],23245204.0,"Monad has a specific set of mathematical rules, though, which have important properties which make them well-suited for some very specific tasks, including defining the semantics of programming languages.<p>I&#x27;m not aware of any &quot;simple everyday concept&quot;, or anything in any mainstream programming language, that comes close to being equivalent to what monads are. You can find examples of specific monads being used (and misused) in many ordinary programs, because of their deep connection to programming language design, but they&#x27;re never explicitly identified as such, partly because most languages can&#x27;t conveniently make use of an abstraction like that.<p>Similarly, there&#x27;s more to catamorphisms than what you describe. What you described is essentially what the generic mathematical concept of a catamorphism looks like in a specific context, but that&#x27;s like saying that the term &quot;vehicle&quot; is just the simple everyday concept of a bicycle dressed up with a complicated neologism.<p>Something similar goes for bifunctor. `Either` is an example of a bifunctor, but it&#x27;s also an example of a functor. Conflating the generic concept with specific instances will mislead you.<p>The point about this terminology, and the concepts it represents, is that it classifies these abstractions with precise rules, allowing the commonality across many different abstractions to be identified and exploited in well-defined, rigorous ways.<p>You don&#x27;t find that in mainstream programming languages or the literature about them. The closest you&#x27;ll come is things like object-oriented collection class hierarchies - Collection &#x2F; List &#x2F; Set &#x2F; OrderedSet etc. That kind of classification is analogous to the sort of terms we&#x27;re discussing, but is nowhere near as well-factored or mathematically rigorous.<p>&gt; This eventually boils down to everything becoming for-comprehensions &#x2F; do-notations.<p>What language are you thinking of? Sounds like Scala maybe. Unfortunately I think Scala was a mistake from the point of view of introducing functional programming to a wider audience. The object&#x2F;functional mixture results in a kind of worst of both worlds that doesn&#x27;t show off the benefits of either to best effect.<p>&gt; usually typed FP code nowadays are full of compromises in the name of typing.<p>&gt; But it&#x27;s very easy to run into real world problems that require &quot;hacks&quot; or inelegant solutions, or forces the correct solution, which is very time consuming.<p>Perhaps you&#x27;ve had this experience from experimenting with functional languages, but it&#x27;s not my experience from actually using languages like Haskell and OCaml in real projects for many years. I&#x27;m also very experienced with many mainstream languages - Java&#x2F;Javascript&#x2F;C&#x2F;C++&#x2F;Python etc. - and I find functional languages to be models of elegance by comparison. Statically debugging code by designing the types well (&quot;make illegal states unrepresentable&quot;) is a huge timesaver when it comes to avoiding bugs and making significant changes to large codebases easier.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of research on extending the power of type systems, which it seems like you may be thinking of, but for most ordinary purposes, you don&#x27;t need to worry about that.",1589999123,comment,,,0.9535,0.063

He ended up repeating the mistake made with Arrays in the JVM.<p>I sat down and did the math once while contemplating writing my own collections API, and found a much smaller representation based on the observation that the read-only parts of some collections are equivalent, and hence don&#x27;t deserve a separate type. This got me down to about 12% more interfaces, which I thought was probably worth it for essentially splitting everything in two, especially since it reduces the amount of Type Variance the user has to deal with (especially before they added inference to type declarations).<p>For collections, most of the substitution problem is around shared state, and the differences between readers and writers.<p>So now I&#x27;m thinking about borrow semantics in for instance Rust. When you are handed an object reference, you are only getting part of the interface for that object, unless you have made arrangements for the caller to give you control of the internal state of that object. Most, but certainly not 100%, of the covariance that I see in interfaces revolves around updating state. For instance you don&#x27;t have to make a contains() function covariant to fulfill LSP. Because obviously the answer to &quot;does this set of integers contain the string &#x27;foo&#x27;&quot; is no, it doesn&#x27;t.

They are ready enough to be your soldiers whilst you do not make war, but if war comes they take themselves off or run from the foe; which I should have little trouble to prove, for the ruin of Italy has been caused by nothing else than by resting all her hopes for many years on mercenaries, and although they formerly made some display and appeared valiant amongst themselves, yet when the foreigners came they showed what they were.

BEAM is good as long as you don&#x27;t need to do heavy computation, but lack of type-safety (need to use dialyzer?) means that shit breaks in prod that the compiler would have caught.

544,pritambaral,23250347,,23246514.0,"&gt; Under the SanDisk and Lasercomb cases, you couldn&#x27;t simply un-agree to the license, because it was a software purchase, or a patent license respectively, but the SSPL is a license that is validated and invalidated and renewed automatically (see clause 8: Termination), and for which the acceptable, enforceable outcome of any litigation is always &quot;stop providing the copyrighted work as a service&quot;.<p>So what? The automatic termination of a license doesn&#x27;t make it valid, nor does it stop it from being invalid. Even in the presence of the termination clause, the SSPL asserts rights over works it does not cover. _That_ is copyright abuse, exactly like in the Lasercomb and SanDisk cases. The fact that those licenses differed in other areas does not affect this fact.<p>But yeah, thank you for bringing up the termination clause, as it further strengthens my point that using an SSPL-licensed work is like entering a legal minefield. As I say in my parent comment, if tomorrow MongoDB Inc. decides to interpret &quot;Service&quot; differently than today,  invoking the termination clause, suddenly I would be forced to stop using the software. This mere possibility makes it unsafe for me to use the software now.<p>&gt;&gt; 1. You can&#x27;t just &quot;run it if I wish&quot; as you please; and<p>&gt;&gt; 2. That is NOT the definition of open-source; that is the definition of shared-source, or source-available.<p>&gt; Name one thing I can&#x27;t do with it. No, providing it as a service does not count, as I can do that, provided I manage the service with other SSPL&#x27;d code.<p>At this point, I&#x27;m beginning to suspect you&#x27;re being pedantic and willfully ignoring practical realities. You&#x27;re also being selective and ignoring the rest of my argument: merely being able to run your modifications under certain conditions does NOT make something &#x27;Open Source&#x27;. And, please, read the rest of my argument, which I reproduce here for your convenience: &quot;If MongoDB wanted to make their source available under those terms, they should have, instead of trying to abuse the term &#x27;open source&#x27;. If you want to use a piece of software under shared-source terms, feel free, but please don&#x27;t try to jam it to others as if that&#x27;s open source, because such twisting of terms harms the industry&quot;",1590000607,comment,,,-0.3111,0.096

I worked at one of the few small companies that provided free Openstreetmap-powered basemaps at the time: you could just grab our map tile URL, plug it into Leaflet or any other mapping lib, and get a instant basemap with OSM data, provided you gave credit to us and under some not really restrictive ToS. In fact you probably used us at the time.<p>The technology behind those tiles wasn&#x27;t really sophisticated back then -- a few oversized and replicated PostgreSQL servers with PostGIS and the OSM data loaded and synchronized frequently with a few materialized views on top, and a bunch of servers painting tiles with Mapnik using them as a source (there are a few options that started to prove to be more efficient at the time, but that&#x27;s what we decided to go on then for other reasons), with a few layers of caching on the front.
Tile rendering times for cache misses weren&#x27;t really good depending on the complexity of the requested tile, given most stuff wasn&#x27;t prerendered, but once things got cached and since most popular maps were localized to specific regions that got quickly cached, this worked pretty well after the first visitor had came.<p>But then... Pokemon Go and your bazillion maps came with the worst scale test for our design you could ever think of: a volume of tile requests a few levels of magnitude higher than usual, of locations from the half of the world playing Pokemon Go back then, zooming to _their streets_ (which were randomly distributed all over the world and therefore most probably uncached at that zoom level) to try and find their closest Charmanders.<p>Needless to say, those were some few nice days of firefighting and playing whack-a-mole replicating databases, adjusting caches, banning requests from the worst offenders and, at some of the worst points, everything that included the word &quot;poke&quot; on their domain.",1590001118,comment,,,0.7288,0.062

774,kmill,23250577,,23243279.0,"One reason people care about knots in low-dimensional topology is that every compact (&quot;finite-volume&quot;) 3-dimensional manifold without boundary can be constructed by taking a 3-sphere (the set of points in R^4 unit distance from the origin), boring out tubes along a collection of disjoint knots, then gluing solid tori (&quot;donuts&quot;) back in in a different way, a process called Dehn surgery.  This is the Lickorish-Wallace theorem.  Sort of the intuition is that if you take a 3-manifold and have worms eat out enough closed loops, the manifold loses its integrity and becomes indistinguishable from the complement of a collection of disjoint knots.  (Lickorish&#x27;s version of the proof involves a theorem that&#x27;s colloquially known as the Lickorish Twist Theorem.)<p>In particular, every 3-manifold is the boundary of a 4-manifold obtained in a way that&#x27;s reminiscent of knot traces from the article.  You take a disjoint collection of knots in the boundary of a 4-ball, then glue in the 1-handles (&quot;caps&quot; in the article) along these knots, but with slight change: you glue in 1-handles with any framing whatsoever, not just the 0-framing like in knot traces (and actually using just +1-framing and -1-framing is sufficient).  It&#x27;s actually a remarkable fact in its own right that every 3-manifold bounds a 4-manifold; this is saying the 3-dimensional cobordism group is trivial.  Other-dimensional cobordism groups are not trivial in general.<p>Every 3-manifold has a diagram, then, consisting of a multi-component knot (known as a link) with each component labeled by an integer (or a rational number if you are ok with &quot;fake&quot; surgeries).  There is a whole thing called the Kirby calculus that gives a sufficient set of moves to go between any two such representations of a particular 3-manifold.  An extension to this calculus went into Piccirillo&#x27;s calculations with knot traces -- she cites the classic Gompf and Stipsicz for details.<p>One use of this representation of a 3-manifold is to construct Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants, which are sequences of numbers associated to a 3-manifold.  This is related to the Jones polynomial, and these invariants satisfy a number of wonderful properties that together mean they form a topological quantum field theory (TQFT).  I don&#x27;t know the physics, but I&#x27;m under the impression you can interpret it as having something to do with quantum states of anyonic particles.<p>For books, you might look at Adams &quot;The Knot Book&quot; or Prasolov &quot;Intuitive Topology&quot; to get a substantial taste of knots and low-dimensional topology.",1590001945,comment,,,0.9781,0.011

817,jacoblambda,23250620,[23251684],23249970.0,"The GOTO topic is an interesting one because Dijkstra inadvertently started a cult around the avoidance of GOTO. Dijkstra never intended this and one of the main reasons this occurred was because Dijkstra&#x27;s original paper &quot;A Case Against the Goto Statement&quot; was editorialised as a letter to the author type article to speed up publication which resulted in the famous title &quot;Goto Statement Considered Harmful&quot;.<p>This is a topic where both him and other prominent figures such as Donald Knuth have since its publication repeatedly argued for moderation in use of the GOTO statement and against the total avoidance of GOTOs.<p>My go to example for this is that in C and other languages that lack modern comforts such as exceptions(for better or worse) and destructors, GOTOs can largely simplify the handling of clean-up and error recovery code.<p>Another example is longjmp which is very useful in kernel-space or bare metal programming, and in implementation details for exception handling however outside of those niches, serves no purpose.<p>GOTO serves a very useful niche but can also make code nigh impossible to follow. Most other structured programming statements have the same threat but we have rules in place to avoid their abuse. The following cases can result in code that is just as problematic:<p>IF&#x2F;ELSEIF&#x2F;ELSE: overly large, overly nested, or mutating variables.<p>SWITCH&#x2F;CASE: complicated fall-through.<p>FOR: mutating counter variables, mutating termination condition.<p>TRY&#x2F;CATCH&#x2F;FINALLY&#x2F;THROW: exception hell&#x2F;deep uncaught exceptions.<p>These control flow mechanisms should definitely be preferred to GOTO in most cases but they can be just as badly abused if you aren&#x27;t careful. The big difference I find is that people are taught how not to abuse these mechanisms but most material about the proper uses of GOTO is almost taboo because of the cargo cult around avoiding its use.<p>Sorry if this doesn&#x27;t really fit into the discussion but it&#x27;s interesting to me how an initially very tame and rational counter-argument spawned a massive cargo cult.",1590002176,comment,,,-0.8427,0.105

But get deep-enough into absorbing the Zen of Erlang (i.e. by trying to write a big-deal telecom system; or by working on a distributable Erlang DBMS like CouchDB), and you&#x27;ll come to appreciate it. Specifically, you&#x27;ll realize that it&#x27;d actually be impossible for the Erlang runtime system to support hot-code-reload <i>plus</i> automatic distribution <i>plus</i> static typing, all at once. One of them has to give. (I think this is one of those universal &quot;choose only two properties&quot; triangles, like CAP, though I don&#x27;t think this one has a name.)<p>If you have a &quot;living&quot; distributed system—one that you don&#x27;t bring down entirely for each upgrade—then inevitably you&#x27;ll hit a situation where a node with the fresh new version of a module (V3, let&#x27;s say), tries to use that module to send a V3 message to a node that is still only running V2 of the module. In a distributed system with static typing, that&#x27;ll inevitably crash the V2 node—<i>unless</i> you did a whole extra &quot;V2.5&quot; rollout step to first teach V2 about the wire-format of V3 and how to handle it.<p>Much of the point of Erlang&#x2F;Elixir&#x27;s user-facing &quot;data architecture&quot; design—e.g. using <i>partial</i> destructuring pattern-matching (unwrapping tuples one layer at a time) instead of uniquely tagging messages with message-type UUIDs like COM&#x2F;CORBA—is to &quot;automatically&quot; cope with this, allowing your &quot;living&quot; distributed system to interoperate in the face of cross-node module-version heterogeneity, without having to write explicitly backcompat &quot;also recognize the previous&#x2F;next version of the message&quot; code during the rollout period.<p>Every Erlang term sent in a message is, in some sense, like a little extensible file-format; and the tools you&#x27;re given to &quot;parse&quot; the term—when you use them idiomatically—give you forward-compatible &quot;parsing.&quot; As long as you don&#x27;t validate that a term has a specific &quot;deep&quot; structure corresponding to some static type, then it doesn&#x27;t matter if your module-V2 actor has actually received—and is now holding onto—a module-V3 parameter in its state. It won&#x27;t know what to do with it, but nor will that cause any problems as long as it doesn&#x27;t poke too hard at it. It can even keep hold of it, storing it away for later in its state generically, without understanding exactly what it&#x27;s received. It&#x27;ll be there in the state for when the module upgrades to V3, and suddenly cares about that property.<p>(OTP&#x27;s supervision system also comes into play here, ensuring that any unhandled edge-cases of this term &quot;parsing&quot; just become temporary restarts of the leaf-actors that receive them, without affecting the stability of the node as a whole. The network upgrade completes; the affected actors come back up running the new module version; the system continues.)",1590003188,comment,,,0.9844,0.021

Except for - it doesn&#x27;t work with immutable classes (the ones with readonly fields).

I just don&#x27;t see a Rails-esque competitor rising from JS land anytime soon and gaining enterprise market share. Cloud has to do with it because Cloud is increasingly how applications are created. Instead of a large framework to create an application with a language (Spring for Java, Rails for Ruby, Django for Python), applications are now mishmashes of cloud functions, no sql tables, sql data stores, message queues and auth wrappers, all of those without a specific language requirement. Like I said in my original comment, it forces every language based framework to question it&#x27;s (comparatively) monolithic nature. This isn&#x27;t a fool proof prediction by any means, but with the rise of cloud architectures I really don&#x27;t foresee any languages birthing a monolith anytime soon.

If that particular plot of land was <i>stolen</i> then the people it was stolen from are welcome to assert their claim. If they can prove that they have one, that is. A thief (&quot;conqueror&quot;) does not through their theft obtain the rights to the property which is stolen, and cannot rightfully sell what they do not own. The buyer acquires nothing, and (if innocent) is welcome to sue the thief for fraud to recover what they paid.<p>However, leaving the ownership uncontested for this long would certainly dilute any claim based on ancestral rights. If there comes a point where no one else is claiming rightful ownership of the land then any prior claim can be considered abandoned, and whoever happens to be using it at that point holds the rights to it by default. Even if it was originally stolen. So the question becomes, <i>has</i> someone maintained their claim to the land and passed it down to their descendents from 1066 until now?

For example, by open sourcing React, FB not only can influence JS frameworks in general, it can cultivate a hiring pool of engineers already familiar or proficient with React internals.

Meritocracy is just another way to grant those born with advantages yet more advantages.  The most fortunate people in a meritocracy are those born smarter and with greater capacity to learn, or those born into an environment to foster a mental framework that lends itself to success. Meritocracy rewards the fortunate with wealth and success just as much as a system that provides power by default to those born into wealth or beauty (though arguably the recipients of the benefit are more diffuse). The real difference on which to select such a system is not a matter of <i>justice</i> then, it&#x27;s a matter of which one provides better outcomes. Here, I agree with the article.

You need to internalize their advice and techniques (as OP managed to do on their own), and therapy is about creating a facilitative environment to alter that conception of self.<p>In therapy, you are unconditionally accepted with positive regard, which facilitates viewing yourself more clearly without the need to lean on self-defeating coping mechanisms, like self-pity or shifting blame. As social creatures we instinctively perform a lot of mirroring of others&#x27; mental state, so simply by being accepted we are able to try on what it is like to accept ourselves. It&#x27;s leveraging an additional set of tools baked into us at a deep level to build self awareness and a more positive, realistic self model.<p>If you&#x27;re struggling, I&#x27;d like to echo others and strongly recommend you reach out to a psychiatrist and psychologist if they are within reach for you.

(NASDAQ:ERTS) announced the company will donate the original SimCity™ -- the blockbuster 1989 game credited with giving rise to the city-building game genre -- to each computer in the One Laptop per Child (OLPC) initiative. OLPC is a not-for-profit humanitarian effort to design, manufacture and distribute inexpensive laptops with the goal of giving every child in the world access to modern education. By gifting SimCity onto each OLPC laptop, EA is providing users with an entertaining way to engage with computers as well as help develop decision-making skills while honing creativity. This is the first time a major video game publisher has gifted a game to the world.<p>Open Sourcing SimCity, by Chaim Gingold: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@donhopkins&#x2F;open-sourcing-simcity-58470a275446"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@donhopkins&#x2F;open-sourcing-simcity-58470a2...</a><p>&gt;Excerpt from page 289–293 of “Play Design”, a dissertation submitted in partial satisfaction of the requirements for the degree of Doctor in Philosophy in Computer Science by Chaim Gingold.<p>&gt;[...] The next chapter looks closely at the code to SimCity, which is possible only because it has been open sourced. There are few instances in which a company has open sourced the code to a commercial game, which makes the story of how this happened remarkable for a number of reasons. Recounting this story not only explains the provenance of my research materials, but reveals how social forces, in this case a heterogeneous collection of agents and agendas, shape software.<p>&gt;[...] Surprisingly, Electronic Arts agreed to the arrangement. Their legal counsel, in consultation with Eben Moglen (Columbia Law Professor, general counsel to the FSF, and OLPC advisor), worked through the legal logistics. This effort was aided by Hopkins’s discovery and copying of the original Maxis&#x2F;DUX licensing agreement, on a lark, while working on The Sims. Hopkins did the coding work of the conversion. EA executives approved of the endeavor, no doubt aided by Will Wright’s legendary persuasiveness and considerable prestige, not to mention the prestige of the OLPC project itself.
